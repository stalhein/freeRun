# FreeRun

FreeRun is a personal project of mine where eventually the end product will be a polished 2D ininite platformer.
I am also using it as my oportunity to expand on my knowladge of C by writing this game in C++.

Currently this is only on a really early build whith working out movment and classes but screenshots will be availble further into devleopment

<br>

## If you would like to build it yourself

for linux run in the root of the directory:

```

  ./build.sh

```

This file simply compiles the code using g++ and will run the output file.

<br>

## Dependancies

This game uses **raylib** and is compiled using **g++**.

### to install

(assuming your on a debian distro of linux)

```

  sudo apt install g++
  sudo apt install libraylib-dev

```
